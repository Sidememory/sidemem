# sidemem
A side memory for podman providing a data space and a workspace
Designed to work with NixOS principally
Project in development.
Unstable.
Current version only includes opencode but it could theoritically work for any such programs and even with real users in a whiteboard if there's such a multi user whiteboard for podman to begin with.
W.I.P.
Probably won't work on your end.
